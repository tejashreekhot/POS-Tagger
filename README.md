# POS-Tagger
Used probabilistic inference methods in a real-world Natural Language Processing problem, by building a part-of-speech tagger using inference on Bayesian networks models. 
Implemented the POS Tagger using Naive Bayes, the Viterbi algorithm, MCMC algorithm and Approximate max-marginal inference.
